compass-stylesheets
===================

Extracted [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) stylesheets to be used outside of Ruby / SASS / Compass.

For example, you could use them with one of the [libsass](http://libsass.org/) implementations:
- [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc)
- [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)

Extracted from Compass `0.12.6`

Tested on node-sass `0.9.3`
